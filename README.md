README file for DragonFire AI project
Creators: Patricia Delafuente and Marcus McAllister

The DragonFire AI project makes use of multiple existing codebases and datasets.  An inventory of referenced material is listed below:

- ScienceWorld repository (https://github.com/allenai/ScienceWorld) - Contains Python + Scala code for a random agent and human-interactive agent.  Instructions for running these agents are found in the dedicated README for the ScienceWorld repository.

- CALM-ScienceWorld repository (https://github.com/cognitiveailab/calm-scienceworld) - Contains Python code for training an intelligent agent to solve ScienceWorld tasks using OpenAI GPT-2.  Instructions for training this agent are found in the dedicated README for the CALM-ScienceWorld repository.  Note that the hardware requirements for training the models are significant, so training may take significantly longer on average compute platforms.

- DragonFire Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EteF1cjATzAdFOUvCkIhObi_1JEJguWd?usp=sharing) - Contains Llama3.1 model and limited GPT-2 model trained on ScienceWorld tasks.  Also includes supporting infrastructure and logs for runs of these models.
